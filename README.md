# Simultaneous Estimation of Multi-year Multiple Systems Data

This repository contains the code and data files for executing the data analysis.

The data required for our analysis contains TRS data for 6 years of Adolescent Pregnancy in Thailand and are stored as a csv file named 'Adolescent Pregnancy Data.csv'. This must be read in the beginning of the data analysis code by updating its file path accordingly.

The data analysis codes are as follows:

1.Ad_Preg Random_Effect Code_Jeffrey: Data Analysis code under Prior I.

2.Ad_Preg Random_Effect Code_Binomial: Data Analysis code under Prior II.

Each of these codes will reproduce required estimates and trace plots.

If the user wishes to use this code for a different dataset they may do so by replicating the dataset in the form of TRS (as shown in the above mentioned csv file) and may tune the parameters accordingly in the code.
